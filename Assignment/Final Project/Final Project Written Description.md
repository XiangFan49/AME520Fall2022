## Final Project Written Description

### Project Title: Irena in Wonderland
### Design Goals: To explore the application of neural perception theories such as embodied/disembodied cognition and enactivism in spatial phenomenology through computer graphics technology. The practice should use computer-generated visual information to have some effect on human cognition, such as optical illusions, and correct them in motion.
### Target Audience: Anyone interested in the above field and curious about its impact on the development of complex interactive systems/video games.
