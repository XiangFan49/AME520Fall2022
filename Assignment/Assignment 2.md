* During Monday's somatology experience, I first noticed the dazzling lights and then tried to follow my instructor's order to turn my arm. During this process, I couldn't move my arms by imitating the movements of the other students because we were lying down. Also, since the floor is very tingling for me, I try not to let my arms touch the ground so my shoulders are a little stiff after long periods of suspension. Even so, as I moved my arms slowly, I still felt the muscles in my chest, shoulders and arms stretch and relax. And I noticed a little bit different than usual when my focus was on my arm, I felt it was a bit bigger and heavier than usual. Also my arm movements became easier and more relaxed after a long period of practice, especially with the addition of leg movements. I feel my arms are lighter after the whole class.
