### For your first exercise with optitrack; create a mocap recording, 1-2 minutes long, in a bvh file (https://research.cs.wisc.edu/graphics/Courses/cs-838-1999/Jeff/BVH.html) as a deliverable for this assignment. We will be learning how to integrate bvh into 3D environments in the next couple of classes.

### Consider the 1-2 mins of movement you are going to capture carefully; its qualities e.g., tempo, range, in space, weight, volume, etc] and other physical properties. As well, consider its function; reaching, running, turning [to see something/someone?] architecture for something /someone else? These are different kinds of questions that may or may not be linked to a meaning you are looking to convey in your final project. Please: Write down your movement ‘score’ [descriptive text and/or image is fine] for 1 -2 mins, including your considerations of above Create the capture recording in the Optitrack system Reflect on what you have made, and revise your score accordingly.
