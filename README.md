### Please watch this video (https://www.ted.com/talks/daniel_wolpert_the_real_reason_for_brains) and answer the following questions:

1. Why is Baysian inference applicable modeling how the brain performs movement?
* Because the brain's noise in signal transmission leads to biased control of movement and uncertainty in decision-making, Bayesian models are needed to make predictions and learn how the brain works.
2. What do you think about the evolutionary adaptation of the "best" (optimal) movement we all share?
* I think it is necessary for us to evolve as organisms. In order to pass genes better, we must better adapt to the complex and changeable environment on land to obtain energy, so we need to develop the skills of movement, and perception and consciousness are nothing but movement by-products of this need.
3. Please share your thoughts on the concept of "noise" the presenter discussed. How do you think the brain resolves this noise?
* I think in the first place that noise is a result of our adaptation to the environment during our evolution as organisms. It can be understood as a defect, maybe because of a lack of enough energy or nutrients to maintain a less noisy brain, but more likely because The evolution of the brain to this state is enough to give humans an edge over natural selection. Because this noise must be overcome or reduced through practice and repetitive movements, learning becomes possible. This allows the experience accumulated by previous generations to be passed on through learning, which significantly increases the speed at which we evolve as a species.
4. Can you think of any modeling framework/technology that could perform better than Baysian modeling?
* I think Markov chain is a better model than Baysian modeling. the recent development of MCMC methods has made it possible to compute large hierarchical models that require integrations over hundreds to thousands of unknown parameters
5. Do you think lack of movement (think "metaverse") lead us to digest our brains?
* First of all, I think that the lack of movement in humans may cause specific areas in the brain to degenerate, but it is unlikely that we will lose our brains because then we will not be able to continue to survive. Because neither the way our society works nor the hidden expression of our genes has a way to keep us completely still for energy and nutrients. Furthermore, movements in imaginary spaces such as meditation, although not real movements because they involve less real-world detail and therefore less real-time information processing, are still examples of exercise. And make our understanding of abstract concepts ability to a higher level.

1. Why is understanding the history of interaction important for current designers?
2. How will understanding interaction help us navigate emerging technologies -- AR, XR etc.
3. Can you summarize the history of Human Computer Interaction from this paper (in 2 paragraphs)
  
### Please read this text:https://github.com/tejaswigowda/ame520Fall2022/blob/main/READINGS/HCI_Design_Somatics_WITHCOMMENTS_p54-loke-schiphorst-thesomaticturninhuman-computerinteraction.pdf Can you please answer these:

1. What does somatics have to offer to the field of HCI?
* Somatic practices explicitly frame the moral relationship between self-care and our ability to care and act in the world. Somatics proposes an improved practice of self-cultivation, aligned with the social principles of research through HCI design, to transform the world from its current state to a preferred state. Somatic approaches in HCI build on established methods of role-playing, scenario enactment, bodystorming, and other performative approaches inspired from theater practices, which advocate for an embodied understanding of design situations and the generative power of physical engagement by thinking through doing (or moving). In addition to the technological tools currently being developed (such as personal medical informatics for processing data and analysis), somatic approaches can provide individuals with the tools and techniques to gain some sense of control over their own mental, emotional, and physical health.
2. What are the 4 somatic values?
* Self as a set of states
* Attention as an operator
* Experience as a skill
* Interconnectedness as empathy
3. How can somatic studies be applied to your current field of study/research?
* Somatic studies are highly relevant to the sensory systems I study, and research in evolutionary psychology has shown that our sensory systems, and even consciousness itself, are simply by-products of the body's adaptation to movement in the environment. Therefore understanding our senses through the lens of somatics will provide more realistic results.
