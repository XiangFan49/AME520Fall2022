1. Please watch this video (https://www.ted.com/talks/daniel_wolpert_the_real_reason_for_brains) and answer the following questions:

  * Why is Baysian inference applicable modeling how the brain performs movement?
  * What do you think about the evolutionary adaptation of the "best" (optimal) movement we all share?
  * Please share your thoughts on the concept of "noise" the presenter discussed. How do you think the brain resolves this noise?
  * Can you think of any modeling framework/technology that could perform better than Baysian modeling?
  * Do you think lack of movement (think "metaverse") lead us to digest our brains?
 
2. Next read this text: https://github.com/tejaswigowda/ame520Fall2022/blob/main/READINGS/Dourish%20excerpt%20chap1'HistoryofInteraction.pdf Answer these questions:
